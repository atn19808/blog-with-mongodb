# Blog with MongoDB

Added some extra functionality such as dynamic routing to original boiler plate.
Deployed the website onto Heroku using Node.js, and stored blog posts into MongoDB

A Project from one of my favorite Udemy Course. The Complete 2019 Web Development Bootcamp - by Angela Yu.

Highly Recommended.
